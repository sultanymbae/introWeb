#1. Print numbers from 1 to 10 using both for and while loops
#Using for and range

for i in range(1, 11): #Iterate from 0 to 10
    print(i)

#Using while
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1 #To avoid infinite loop

#2. Use for loop to iterate over the string "Python" and print each character
for char in "Python":
    print(char)

#3. Create a while loop that prints even numbers from 2 to 10
i =2
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 2
